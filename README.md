Ghostscript 9.06 was [released on August 8, 2012](https://code.google.com/archive/p/ghostscript/downloads?page=2). The next release, Ghostscript 9.07, changed the license from the GPL to the AGPL.

This is a copy of Ghostscript 9.06, the final GPL'ed Ghostscript.

It has been lightly edited to silence warnings from modern compilers, and then lightly edited more to be able to build with emscripten.

To build:

```
./configure CFLAGS=-funsigned-char
make
sudo make install
```

Note the flags to set char to default to unsigned.
